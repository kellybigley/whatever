Haunted Places around Savannah, Ga
=========================

Some details about Savannah blah blah blah  
The pictures in this project were taken on a dark night in Savannah with a Nikon Ultra Pro Super Res Camera With Zoom Lens.  

=========================

This repository make use of [StoryMap.js](http://storymap.knightlab.com/), an open source javascript [library](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS) that allows the user to create stories with maps. This implementation uses a custom configuration to host the map, data, and contents on [GitHub](https://github.com/kellybigley/haunted-savannah-storymap) instead of the easier to use generator featured on the StoryMap.js homepage. The basemap for this project was created using Stamen Design's [MapStack](http://mapstack.stamen.com/) project, which allows ultra customization of Stamen's tiled basemap services with photoshop-like filters.
